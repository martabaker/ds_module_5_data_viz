Data Visualization in Matplotlib and Seaborn Homework

For this homework assignment, I used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy to clean a dataset that contained mice with tumors who were treated using a range of different drugs, find the summary statistics for Tumor Volume (mm3) for each Drug Regimen, found the outliers, IQR for 4 drugs, and with the cleaned data, created a range of bar charts, pie charts, boxplots, line charts, and scatterplots with a line of best fit.

With the data and charts, I was able to determine that both Capomulin and Ramicane look to have the lowest final tumor volumes when compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin (per the "Boxplot of Final Tumor Volume per Drug Regimen" chart). However, when looking at "Observed Mouse Timepoints per Drug Regimen" bar charts, Capomulin and Ramicane had roughly 50 more observed timepoints despite all 4 drug regimens have 25 mice each (shown under "Quartiles, Outliers & Boxplots". As a result, while it is possible for Capomulin and Ramicane to be more effective drugs at decreasing tumor volume in comparison to Infubinol and Ceftamin, it is also possible that Capomulin and Ramicane had a final timepoint that was greater than Infubinol or Ceftamin. Finally, in mice treated with Capomulin, mouse weight and average tumor volume had a strong positive correlation.
